- 🫡 Hi, I’m @LauraAllObe
- 🌞 I’m interested in Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, and Web and Mobile App Development. Currently, I am seeking a part-time or paid internship
  position remotely or in-person in the Hoboken, New Jersey area.
- ✍️ I’m currently working on a fat32 little endian file system in C and on moving and refining my previous projects, such as by adding demonstration videos.
- 📒 I have already learned C++ (which covered basic syntax, Dynamic Memory Allocation, inheritance, and Aggregation and Composition), C# (full-stack web application development which
  covered .NET, MAUI, EF Context[Factory], and json), mySQL, json, html, xml, SQLite, java (full-stack web application development), python (full-stack web application development which
  also covers SQLite and gunicorn and nginx configuration), C (which covered a shell implementation, a linux kernel elevator module, and a fat32 little endian file system), Data
  Organization (which covers Assembly Language, MIPS coding, pipeline, ALU, single-cycle processor, and memory hierarchy), and Data Structure (which covers vectors, linked lists, 
  queues, stack, binary heaps, priority queue, topological sorting, various sorting algorithms [bubble, insertion, shell, mergesort, quicksort, and heaposrt], Algorithm Analysis and 
  Runtime, hash [seperate chaining and linear probing], trees traversals, a complete binary tree vector representation, and binary search trees).
- 📜 My best individual projects can be found in the Summer2022Proj0 (C#) and ________ (Python) (future python repo to move from GitLab). My best team projects can be found in the
  finalProject (Java), ______ (C) (future COP4610 proj 1 repo clone), and ____ (C) (future COP4610 proj 3 repo clone).
