- 🫡 Hi, I’m @LauraAllObe
- 🤓 I’m interested in Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, and Web and Mobile App Development.
- ✍️ I’m currently learning C# and .NET (to develop a downplayed version of the legal practice management software, PracticePanther), Advanced Programming with Java, and Mobile Programming 
  using java (with a concentration on Android)
- 📒 I have already learned C++ (which covers basic syntax, Dynamic Memory Allocation, inheritance, and Aggregation and Composition), basics of C# (app design and unity specific), 
  Data Organization (which covers Assembly Language, MIPS coding, pipeline, ALU, single-cycle processor, and memory hierarchy), and Data Structure (which covers vectors, linked lists, 
  queues, stack, binary heaps, priority queue, topological sorting, various sorting algorithms [bubble, insertion, shell, mergesort, quicksort, and heaposrt], Algorithm Analysis and 
  Runtime, hash [seperate chaining and linear probing], trees traversals, a complete binary tree vector representation, and binary search trees)
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
