Introduction
============
    ü´° Hi, I‚Äôm @LauraAllObe. FSU Alumni and current Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) Mastsers student, I've earned my 
    Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and am pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering. With a 3.9 GPA and only 
    2.5 years to earn my Masters (note only 7 entrance credits) as an honors student, graduating before I turned 21 has been
    one of my greatest achievements so far. My goal is to stay in software engineering until I have a good grasp of project 
    flow (a minimum of two years full-time employment), after which I'd like to approach the field of Software Architecture.
    
A Little More About Me:
=======================
    üåû I‚Äôm interested in Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, and Web and Mobile Application
    Development. Currently, I am seeking a part-time or paid internship position remotely or in-person in the Hoboken, 
    New Jersey area. I love to work in teams that are dedicated. Even if not everyone is equally skilled, drive is the main 
    factor that, in my opinion, makes up a good team.
    
About My Repositories and Programming Experience:
=================================================
    ‚úçÔ∏è I‚Äôm currently working on a fat32 little endian file system in C and on moving and refining my previous projects, 
    such as by adding demonstration videos.
    
    üìí I have already learned C++ (which covered basic syntax, Dynamic Memory Allocation, inheritance, and Aggregation and 
    Composition), C# (full-stack web application development which covered .NET, MAUI, EF Context[Factory], and json), mySQL, 
    json, html, xml, SQLite, java (full-stack web application development), python (full-stack web application development 
    which also covers SQLite and gunicorn and nginx configuration), C (which covered a shell implementation, a linux kernel 
    elevator module, and a fat32 little endian file system), Data Organization (which covers Assembly Language, MIPS coding, 
    pipeline, ALU, single-cycle processor, and memory hierarchy), and Data Structure (which covers vectors, linked lists, 
    queues, stack, binary heaps, priority queue, topological sorting, various sorting algorithms [bubble, insertion, shell, 
    mergesort, quicksort, and heaposrt], Algorithm Analysis and Runtime, hash [seperate chaining and linear probing], trees 
    traversals, a complete binary tree vector representation, and binary search trees).
    
    üìú My best individual projects can be found in the Summer2022Proj0 (C#) and ________ (Python) (future python repo to move 
    from GitLab). My best team projects can be found in the finalProject (Java), ______ (C) (future COP4610 proj 1 repo clone), 
    and ____ (C) (future COP4610 proj 3 repo clone).
    
    ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... (nothing to note here so far)
    
  A Brief Overview on All Projects:
  =================================
    /finalProject: full-stack sticky note (android) mobile application in java
    /Summer2022Proj0: full-stack PracticePanther (Law Practice Management Software) implementation in C#
