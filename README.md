## Introduction
üêå Hi, I‚Äôm @LauraAllObe. FSU Alumni and current Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT) Mastsers student, I've earned my 
Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and am pursuing my Masters in Software Engineering. With a 3.9 GPA and only 
2.5 years to earn my Masters (note only 7 entrance credits) as an honors student, graduating before I turned 21 has been
one of my greatest achievements so far. My goal is to stay in software engineering until I have a good grasp of project 
flow (a minimum of two years full-time employment), after which I'd like to approach the field of Software Architecture.

üéª I‚Äôm interested in Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, and Web and Mobile Application
Development. Currently, I am seeking a part-time or paid internship position remotely or in-person in the Hoboken, 
New Jersey area. I love to work in teams that are dedicated. Even if not everyone is equally skilled, drive is the main 
factor that, in my opinion, makes up a good team.

## A Little More About Me:
üß∏ Outside of programming, my main interests and hobbies are resistance training, cooking, ceramics, skin care, and 
anime. Plants and tayloring have also been recent interests of mine. 

üçØ In terms of character, my most pronounced characteristics are my organization, dedication, focus, calm, and humanity;
but also my stubbornness and social illiteracy. I put both my strengths and weaknesses here as I believe everyone to have
them and as I have found a lack of honesty to be only briefly effective at accomplishing one's goals.

## About My Repositories and Programming Experience:
üêª I‚Äôm currently working on a full-stack capstone group project in javascript and refining my previous projects, 
such as by adding demonstration videos.

üíº I have already learned C++ (which covered basic syntax, Dynamic Memory Allocation, inheritance, and Aggregation and 
Composition), C# (full-stack web application development which covered .NET, MAUI, EF Context[Factory], and json), mySQL, 
json, html, xml, SQLite, java (full-stack web application development), python (full-stack web application development 
which also covers SQLite and gunicorn and nginx configuration), C (which covered a shell implementation, a linux kernel 
elevator module, and a fat32 little endian file system), Data Organization (which covers Assembly Language, MIPS coding, 
pipeline, ALU, single-cycle processor, and memory hierarchy), and Data Structure (which covers vectors, linked lists, 
queues, stack, binary heaps, priority queue, topological sorting, various sorting algorithms [bubble, insertion, shell, 
mergesort, quicksort, and heaposrt], Algorithm Analysis and Runtime, hash [seperate chaining and linear probing], trees 
traversals, a complete binary tree vector representation, and binary search trees).

ü¶´ My best individual projects can be found in the Summer2022Proj0 (C#) and hackerNews (Python) (future python repo to move 
from GitLab). My best team projects can be found in the finalProject (Java), proFessUp (JavaScript), and fat32filesystem (C).

ü™∂ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... (nothing to note here so far)
