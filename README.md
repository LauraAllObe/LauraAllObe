- 🫡 Hi, I’m @LauraAllObe
- 🌞 I’m interested in Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, and Web and Mobile App Development.
- ✍️ I’m currently working on an android or MAUI app for the three week semester break 
  using java (with a concentration on Android)
- 📂 This(2023) summer, I learned full-stack web (C#, .NET, MAUI, EF Context[Factory], json) and android app (Android Studio, java) development. Everything I learned on the topic of web development can be found in the Summer2022Proj0 repository. A group project containing a portion of what I learned about android app development can be found in the finalProject repository.
- 📒 I have already learned C++ (which covers basic syntax, Dynamic Memory Allocation, inheritance, and Aggregation and Composition), basics of C# (app design and unity specific), 
  Data Organization (which covers Assembly Language, MIPS coding, pipeline, ALU, single-cycle processor, and memory hierarchy), and Data Structure (which covers vectors, linked lists, 
  queues, stack, binary heaps, priority queue, topological sorting, various sorting algorithms [bubble, insertion, shell, mergesort, quicksort, and heaposrt], Algorithm Analysis and 
  Runtime, hash [seperate chaining and linear probing], trees traversals, a complete binary tree vector representation, and binary search trees)
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
